# farmers_markets
First time using Python! Answering the below questions.

You have been hired by the eccentric leaders of the National Organization of Farmers Market Enthusiasts (NOFME)* to analyze publicly available data on farmers markets throughout the United States for their annual report.

They have provided to you a CSV data file from Data.gov containing information about farmers markets in the United States. Data for each market includes name, full address (including latitude and longitude), product types sold, seasonal availability, and more (see file's column headers). For all of the questions, exclude all markets that are located within a city with more than one word in its name. Use the data in the file to answer the below questions, giving an explanation of the techniques you used to arrive at each answer.

Questions:

1. How many markets sell vegetables, but not anything sweet?
2. What state has the highest density of famers market per capita? What state has the lowest?
3. How many US farmers markets are between the Rocky Mountains and the Mississippi river?
4. What is one fact or pattern about farmers markets in the United States that you can recognize using the raw data?
*Not a real organization.
